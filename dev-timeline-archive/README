This directory contains several binary-only snapshots (spanning across
multiple projects) that were taken during the development of Tarraco.

They range from a basic demo that was used as a starting point to the
full game (version 0.25). There's interesting middle points such the
two collision playgrounds that I created to test the game "engine",
mainly to ensure collision was sound and viable before going for the
full game design.

Sadly lack of git/cvs system means the source code is mostly gone for
these intermediate projects. However some of them still have a full
code snapshot (at least for the VB6 bits).
